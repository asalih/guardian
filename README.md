# DEPRECATED
This repository started as a good idea but I didn't have enough time or desire to work on it. So, it's left here for historical / educational purposes, but be advised it's essentially dead code. If anyone else wants to fork and develop / maintain it, be my guest :)

Guardian is the open source web application firewall based on ModSecurity SecRule format.

# How it works!
Guardian locates in front of your web server and if incoming traffic valid then the Guardian passes it to the target server.
